## Abstraction
**Overview**: Simplifies complexity by modeling high-level structures while hiding implementation specifics.

**Key Aspects**:

- Abstract classes and interfaces define shared behaviors Concrete details are deferred to child classes

**Advanced Concepts**:

- When to use abstract classes vs. interfaces
- How abstraction enables loose coupling and modular design
- Role in modern architectures (e.g., Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design)
